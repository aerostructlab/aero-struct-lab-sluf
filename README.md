# AeroStructLab – SLUF Performance Study

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and plots used to analyze aircraft performance in  
**Steady Level Unaccelerated Flight (SLUF)** conditions.

## ✈️ What is SLUF?

In SLUF, an aircraft flies at constant altitude and speed. This flight regime is defined by:
- Lift = Weight  
- Thrust = Drag  

This equilibrium allows us to analyze key performance metrics as a function of flight speed.

## 📊 What’s inside

The code generates performance curves including:

- ✅ Drag Polar (CD vs CL)
- ✅ Thrust Required vs Airspeed
- ✅ Power Required vs Airspeed
- ✅ Identification of:
  - Minimum drag speed
  - Optimum glide speed
  - Most fuel-efficient cruise speed

## 🧠 Why it matters

Understanding SLUF performance is essential for:
- Aircraft sizing and wing design
- Determining best cruise and glide speeds
- Linking aerodynamic efficiency with structural loads

## 🛠 Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- No additional toolboxes required
